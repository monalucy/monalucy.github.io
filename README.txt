The course encompassed a variety of projects aimed at practical application of the concepts I learned. Here's a breakdown of the completed projects:

Dynamic Login Forms: In this project, I developed dynamic login forms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I practiced error handling, debugging, and enhancing user experience by applying best practices in web form design.

Bootstrap Project: I utilized Bootstrap to build responsive and visually appealing websites. I learned to customize Bootstrap components, create grid layouts, and implement advanced features like modals, carousels, and navigation bars.

Personal Portfolio Website: The final project involved creating a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects. I integrated HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to design and develop a professional-looking portfolio with sections for projects, skills, contact information, and more.
